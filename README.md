# LGHUBDefaultPatcher
Simple tool to take the default profile for any chosen application and replicate that to all selected applications default profiles.

I threw this together in a few hours so it likely has a lot of bugs and ignore the messy code.

# How to use
First of all, I recommend backing up the file that will be getting modified by this tool. It can be found at "C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\AppData\Local\LGHUB\settings.db", make a copy of this file to somewhere secure.

You'll need to close LGHUB before being able to use this tool, close it from the System Tray. When the application is open, select the application you'd like replicated to all others via the radio button. Then select all applications you'd like to be overwritten with this root selection and finally press Process in the bottom right.

# LGHUBDefaultPatcher
Simple tool to takes your profile named "Desktop Standard" and pastes the bindings onto the default profiles of all your applications

I threw this together in a few hours so it likely has a lot of bugs and ignore the messy code.

# Known issues
- When using the tool, you'll lose all macros for all your games along with (expectedly) the bindings of them

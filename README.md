# LGHUBDefaultPatcher
Simple tool to takes your profile named "Desktop Standard" and pastes the bindings onto the default profiles of all your applications

I threw this together in a few hours so it likely has a lot of bugs and ignore the messy code.

# How to use
First of all, I recommend backing up the file that will be getting modified by this tool. It can be found at "C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\AppData\Local\LGHUB\settings.db", make a copy of this file to somewhere secure.

Open up LGHUB and rename the profile you'd like to be copied to all others to "Desktop Standard" (case-sensitive) and then quit the application from the system tray. Run the tool and confirm with "y", after its done, relaunch LGHUB and hopefully this worked for you!
